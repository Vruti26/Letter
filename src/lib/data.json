      "letter": "Hi Dosaaa,\n\n You’ve been with me for almost 3 years now, but honestly, it still feels like we met just yesterday. \n Time always moved fast with you — whether we were laughing like idiots, crying on each other’s shoulders, arguing over the smallest things, or celebrating the best moments of our lives. \n\n I don’t know what life will look like once college ends, and that scares me a little… because you’ve become such a big part of my everyday life that imagining a future without you feels impossible. You were there at every stage, every breakdown, every achievement, every silent moment I didn’t know how to put into words. \n\nI still remember our Vadodara trip — the way we went all alone, figuring things out, having the time of our lives. You were the first person I ever travelled with. My first company. My first comfort. My first kiss. My first “safe space.” And even though we aren’t dating, what we have is something rare… something stronger than labels. I genuinely enjoy your company in a way that’s hard to explain. You’ve been my constant, my person, my go-to for everything — jokes, problems, random thoughts, late-night drama, and silent moments too.It’s been a journey, a beautiful one, and I don’t think I’d trade a single moment of it. \n\n Whatever happens next, I just want you to know this: you are irreplaceable to me. And no matter where life takes us, a part of me will always carry our memories, our madness, and our friendship.Because what we have… it’s not ordinary. It’s us."
