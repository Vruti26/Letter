      "letter": "Hi Dosaaa,\n\n You’ve been with me for almost 3 years now, but honestly, it still feels like we met just yesterday. \n Time always moved fast with you — whether we were laughing like idiots, crying on each other’s shoulders, arguing over the smallest things, or celebrating the best moments of our lives. \n\n I don’t know what life will look like once college ends, and that scares me a little… because you’ve become such a big part of my everyday life that imagining a future without you feels impossible. You were there at every stage, every breakdown, every achievement, every silent moment I didn’t know how to put into words. \n\nI still remember our Vadodara trip — the way we went all alone, figuring things out, having the time of our lives. You were the first person I ever travelled with. My first company. My first comfort. My first kiss. My first “safe space.” And even though we aren’t dating, what we have is something rare… something stronger than labels. I genuinely enjoy your company in a way that’s hard to explain. You’ve been my constant, my person, my go-to for everything — jokes, problems, random thoughts, late-night drama, and silent moments too.It’s been a journey, a beautiful one, and I don’t think I’d trade a single moment of it. \n\n Whatever happens next, I just want you to know this: you are irreplaceable to me. And no matter where life takes us, a part of me will always carry our memories, our madness, and our friendship.Because what we have… it’s not ordinary. It’s us."

Or have I become a distant memory, just that starstruck girl from way back when?\n\nI'm writing this because there are things I never really said. For the longest time, I was so hurt, so angry that you just left me alone. It felt like the ground had vanished from under my feet. Eventually, I started telling myself it was my fault, that I must have been annoying or too much. That was the only way I could make sense of it.\n\nWhat you did taught me a hard lesson about the word 'best friends.' It made me hate the term, to be honest. Because to me, it meant you don't just ghost someone. You don't just disappear and not care about the wreckage you leave behind.\n\nI don't know if you see it the same way, and it probably doesn't matter now. But it was incredibly hard for me. The past is the past, and I know life moves on. I moved on too, but it still feels like I'm stuck in a wormhole\n\nI'm writing this not to get a reply, but to finally let it out. I genuinely hope you have a good life ahead."

I was genuinely so obssessed over your designs and talent—you were like a celeb to me sometimes (I know I'm exaggerating, but it’s true!).\n\nOf course, there was that one time you drove me a little crazy when you wanted everything in blue and just ignored me completely.I know you are kinda stubborn. But looking back, it's just a funny memory.\n\nI know we're more like co-workers since we usually only meet for club work, and that's cool. You’re a great person to work with. But I'd be really happy if we could become good friends too.\n\nIt's been really nice getting to know you."
